ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @odochj

I'm an Analytics Engineer currently exploring how socio-technical factors can impact the automation of Data Platforms. 
A lot of the projects that I'm currently pursuing can be seen through the lens of "I've done the legwork of rallying my business towards a single ideology... what now?"

- [Data Ingestor](https://github.com/odochj/data-ingestor): What if any Data Source could become a Data Product?
- [Data Transformer](https://github.com/odochj/data-transformer): To what extent can you front-load Data Modelling by enforcing a business ontology? 

*Data Transformer* has been designed to feed directly off *Data Ingestor*, with the aim of these being able to form the core of a flexible, composable Data Platform. 
Later additions are likely to incorporate Semantic Layers, Data Visualisation and Machine Learning processes.
